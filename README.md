# Factbook Intelligence

What is the difference between intelligence and data?  This project parses CIA factbook data and attempts to turn some of it into "intelligence".

Theory Of Inteligence 
-
This is the practice of science.  A STEM of journalism and persuation.  Most of all it is the art of finding the truth and incorporating it in yourself and accepting when your world view is discovered to be in error.  


Boyde and OODA
-
Formal science is old and dusty.  The "Scientific Metond (SM)" is essential however we have no time for formal review, publishing, pier review that may take a lifetime.  Instead we MUST use a different method that looks very similar to the SM. Boyde's OODA loop.

In summary; Take raw data -> Huh? what is this -> Create Testable hypothesis -> Act/Test -> push feedback into start.

Through this process you can get/approch correct "intellegence".
